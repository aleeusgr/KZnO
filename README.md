### v0.1 Data 
X must be a normalized dataset. In tx set accordingly: 
* full range of data is loaded, shortest dataset ID'd and all are resampled and saved in a single pd.DataFrame()
* dprep will fetch\read. 
* Visualisation function will get broken. Fix, move to the separate module. Desired functionality: take a pd.Series or np.array as input, fit it to 12byN plot and visualise. 
### v0.2 Model
* Regression task  
* try TFCoder functionality?
* GridCV
* Play with train_x

#### v0.3 Predictive performance
